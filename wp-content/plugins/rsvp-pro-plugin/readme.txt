* Specify the RSVP yes and no text
* Specify the kids meal verbiage
* Specify the vegetarian meal verbiage 
* Specify the text for the note question
* Enter in a custom thank you
* Create a custom message / greeting for each guest
* Import a guest list from an excel sheet (column #1 is the first name, column #2 is the last name, column #3 associated attendees, column #4 custom greeting)
* Export the guest list
* Add, edit and delete guests
* Associate guests with other guests
* Create custom questions that can be asked by each attendee
* Have questions be asked to all guests or limit the question to specific attendees
* Specify email notifications to happen whenever someone rsvps

If there are any improvements or modifications you would like to see in the plugin please feel free to contact me at (mike AT mde DASH dev.com) and 
I will see if I can get them into the plugin for you.

* rsvpParagraph - Class name that is used for all paragraph tags on the front end portion of the RSVP
* rsvpFormField - Class for divs that surround a given form input, which is a combination of a label and at least one form input (could be multiple form inputs)

Prefill Attendee:

Go to the page associated with the RSVP form and add to the querystring the following parameters.

* firstName - For the person's first name
* lastName - For the person's last name
* passcode - If passcode is enabled and/or required this will need to be added as well 

For example if you have a page that is /rsvp for domain example.com your URL might look like - http://www.example.com/rsvp?firstName=test&lastName=test
