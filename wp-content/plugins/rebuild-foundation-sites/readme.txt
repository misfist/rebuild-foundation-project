== Description ==

This plugin registers a custom post type for portfolio items.  It also registers separate portfolio taxonomies for tags and categories.  If featured images are selected, they will be displayed in the column view.

This plugin doesn't change how portfolio items are displayed in your theme.  You'll need to add templates for archive-portfolio.php and single-portfolio.php if you want to customize the display of portfolio items.

== Installation ==

Just install and activate.
