Pea Starter Theme
===

Customized starter theme built using `underscores`.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Generate new custom underscores.me theme.

If you want to keep it simple, head over to http://underscores.me and generate your `_s` based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the "Generate" button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.

OR

* Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`
* Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `megatherium_`
* Search for: `Text Domain: _s` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium` in style.css.
* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>
* Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `megatherium-`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

2. Replace those in the custom underscores.me theme with the following from this theme:

.bowerrc
.gitignore
composer.json
gulpfile.js
inc
    extras.php
package.json
README.md
src
