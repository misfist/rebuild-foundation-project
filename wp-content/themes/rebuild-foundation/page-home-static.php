				<h2>Rebuild's Theory of Neighborhood Transformation</h2>

					<p>Rebuild believes that art and artists can be powerful agents for neighborhood transformation. Taking this foundational belief further:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>If we invest in and mobilize networks of artists, creative entrepreneurs, and scholars in neighborhoods where Rebuild operates</li>  
						<li>If we reactivate underutilized and abandoned buildings in underinvested communities and strive to preserve and reactivate collections of neglected cultural artifacts, and we do so with beautiful art, intentional design, and public cultural programs</li>   
						<li>Then we believe those creative activities will incite movements of community revitalization that neighborhood driven and self sustaining and that will lead to a better quality of life</li>
